# Molecular Evolution
This project takes in a number of individuals "N", a length of genome sequence "L", a rate of mutation "Âµ", a total number of generations "G", 
and a time point for a speciation event "g".
<br/>
<br/>
It then uses this information to create a species of haploid individuals that will reproduce over G generations with each offspring having matching genome 
sequences to the parent but with the addition of a mutation function that will change specific nucleotides to mimic natural mutatation.
<br/>
<br/>
Then, the average genetic distance is calculated and stored. This genetic distance function is currently simplificed and will be improved upon.
